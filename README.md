# Nurse_Robot
In hospitals, the robot receives message from Dr that he needs to check the status of patient to be delivered through QT app. The robot uses advanced vision technology for QR code scanning and detection to detect the QR code of this patient according to his/her room number and send all his/her info to the Dr.
•
Performed full mechanical design for the robot.
•
Applied PID in the real implementation.
•
Developed simulation on coppeliasim for the robot in its environment.
•
Developed socket communication between QT and the pi, communication between Pi & Arduino.
